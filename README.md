Currently, I am working on many projects related to object oriented programming. Every day I try to gain new experience while creating projects.
I am currently working with the following databases: **MongoDB**, **Redis**, **PostgreSQL**. I work with many well-known Polish companies and game servers. 
In my spare time I am also creating builds for Minecraft Servers.
